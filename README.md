Diary of a Rapid Application Build is the journey of an experienced, so-called "senior" developer, building out a full-featured [Trello](http://trello.com) clone â€“ but replacing a more planned, architectural approach with rapid application development techniques.

The aim of the project is to document the shift of mindset required to build applications at speed; what techniques worked, when they worked, what accepted practices got in the way, which assumptions were wrong, and ultimately what got the job done:
