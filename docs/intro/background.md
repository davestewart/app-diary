# Background

> How did this project come into being?

This project was born out an interview technical test to build a simple [Trello](https://trello.com) clone.

The brief was to build only [basic](intro/brief.md) functionality in around 4 hours. Despite experience, planning, research and a little pre-practice, it took me roughly **double** that time to produce the goods, even using frameworks, plugins and bits of code copy/pasted from other projects and the web:

What became clear during the process was just how **long** things take, and with such a tight timescale just how little room for error, or scope for polish there was:

- flexible project configuration was a costly mistake
- best practices and scalable architecture just got in the way
- code had to be scavenged just to get up and running
- polish and pop had to fight tooth and nail for their place
- ideas to "add value" or "over-deliver" looked foolish in context

Whilst I was proud of the eventual result and enjoyed the process to get there, what I found *most* interesting was my emotional reaction to having to ditch skills that have taken years to build up, and supposedly cement my position as a "senior" developer.

Instead of making the project *better*, my arsenal of best practices and gut feeling for scalable architecture actually positioned me *further* from my goal!

This project made me realise a bunch of things:

- *everyone* underestimates the amount of time things take
- the best way is probably not the quickest way, and vice versa
- time constraints are a brilliant defence against fiddling, feature creep and distraction


As mentioned on the [home page](/) I hope to use this insight to allow me to build better sites, more quickly.
