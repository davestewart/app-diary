## Build a Trello clone

We’d like you to write a small Trello clone.

At a minimum, the Trello clone should consist of:

- Lists and Cards
- A list has a required name and a collection of cards
- A card has a required title, required description and an optional due date

A user of the application should:

- Be able to create a new list
- Be able to create a new card in a list
- Be able to move cards between lists

The application should:

- Star cards that have a due date in the next 3 days
- Highlight cards in red that are overdue
- Persist lists and cards (however you like, but local storage is fine)

Please commit the project to a repo of your choice and provide instructions for getting the tests to run and the app to start.

### What we’re not​ looking for

- Implementation in a specific framework - use whatever you like
- User authentication / management. Presume like the user is logged in / hard code any details
- Any unnecessary backends built - this is a frontend test
- Lots of time spent on this. Limit yourself to 4 hours

### What we are​ looking for

- A logical and maintainable approach to solving the problem
- Sensible testing
- Pleasant, functional visuals
- Documentation where necessary
