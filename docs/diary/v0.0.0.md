# Alpha - planning and research

> Plan the application so no surprises in the build

## TLDR

- Set aside half a day for planning and research, but don't over-plan
- Crowdsource research on forums, Facebook and YouTube
- Research for requirements not for backlog!

    
## Overview

I was excited to build the app, but knew the main issue was that it was a short timescale.

As such, in order to not run out of time and deliver nothing, I decided to phase the build as follows:

1. **core features**: lists, tasks, input
1. **interaction**: fluid keyboard interaction, drag and drop
1. **unit tests**: basic tests as requested
1. **additional features**: if possible, add things like routing, pages, search, etc

I planned to use Vue, Vuex and Bulma for the main application, with Vue plugins for drag and drop & persistence.

The one unknown quantity for the challenge was testing; I generally don't do much of it myself and I had no idea how long I should leave to write useful  tests.

To begin, I spent a few hours over the course of the week researching everything that was an unknown entity; Trello, writing tests, and drag and drop plugins.

## Diary

### 2h - Product research

I logged into my unused Trello account and got some lists up and running. It was clear Trello had improved since I last used it, with the text inputs being much more fluid than I remembered them.

Additionally, I asked my friends on Facebook how they use Trello - perhaps I could gain some insight into what other features I could squeeze into the demo! I got various answers, the most useful one being to use it for Agile sprint retrospectives.

At this point I realised I could probably just jump onto YouTube to find people using Trello, and sure enough, you can:

### 1h - Initial planning

As with any project, at this point I began to break down the task into routes, states, layout, components, interaction, etc.

I spent some time in [Workflowy](http://workflowy.com) listing these and ultimately coming up with the phased plan at the top of this page.

Additionally, I had a bunch of ideas for future features too:

- **templates**, to quickly create new sets of lists, such as "to do > doing > done"
- **different board types**, so perhaps Kanban or Scrum boards could be created that might have additional rendering or batch management functionality 
- **normalised data**, might be good to start thinking about that now
- **undo/redo** for item input, like Workflowy. I started to think about global key-logging
- **multi-selectable nodes**, so a user could select and drag multiple items between columns
- **a plugin architecture**, so functionality (even the date functionality) could be stored as attributes and implemented using some kind of globally registered / mixed in plugin functionality (I spend a lot of time thinking about this kind of thing in my Open Source projects)

I had no plans to build these in, though I thought the normalised data structure would be reasonably straightforward, I might get the templates working, and maybe begin on the plugin architecture to show I was thinking ahead.

### 1h 30m - Plugin research

Knowing that lists and tasks was probably the core mechanism, I spent a while googling Vue drag and drop plugins, with the aim to test them online and potentially download one or two and set up some example projects.

The tree plugins looked like an interesting way to combine data and drag and drop in one component, but could possibly come with unforeseen side effects or complication, so after some initial tests, I decided to go with Vue Draggable.

I looked into transitions as well with the motivation to make things smooth and silky.

### 30m - Testing research

Testing being my weakest area, I asked Asked on Reddit about testing; what to test, how to test, what to prioritise, etc:

## Summary

What I didn't know at this point was that architecture choices like Vuex and routing would do nothing but add needless layers of complexity, and planning additional features at this stage was a massive distraction.
