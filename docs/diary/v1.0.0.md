# 1.0 Release

> Addition of missing functionality to mark a first public release

## TLDR

- No real learning, just adding polish

## Overview

This first public release aimed to add features omitted by the original brief:

- board functionality:
    - ability to edit lists
    - ability to remove lists and tasks
    - a dummy demo / empty state

- improvements to board state API:
    - fix weird Smooth Vue DnD functionality
    - improve move item method signature
    - improve item and list parameters and referencing
    - add a robust load data function

The goal is to get the application in a robust state for a 1.0 release that would add core features that would make the clone actually useable for public use.

#### 1hr - Fix weird Vue Smooth DnD behaviour

Whilst writing unit tests for the Beta, I discovered that Vue Smooth DnD's behaviour for communicating a drag was a little funky.

I decided to [make an issue](https://github.com/kutlugsahin/vue-smooth-dnd/issues/16) to find out more about the intended behaviour, and luckily the author was kind enough to reply quite quickly. With a bit of to-and-fro questioning, I realised that the existing behaviour wasn't going to change any time soon, and as I didn't want the store to be governed by the plugin, I would need to write a adapter. 

It took a little bit of thinking to accomplish, but wasn't too much work to write a [helper class](https://github.com/davestewart/app-diary/commit/b927526163042c10f3e4b8371849975ca9ea33fc#diff-39d2e940a60059f261f0176510bcb93e) that would store up the events and only fire when it had the `from` and `to` indices. This cleaned up the board API nicely, and allowed me to write a sensible [move item test](https://github.com/davestewart/app-diary/blob/master/test/unit/specs/store/board.spec.js#L65-L69). 


#### 20m - Added demo functionality

I wanted to add some kind of empty state for demo users, so anyone coming to the app afresh could at least get an idea of what it could do without having to make new lists and tasks.

My initial stab was to add a text link on the `App` page which worked well. I decided to move it soon after to be a button that showed instead of the existing `Reset` button if there were no items (this could be refactored later).

Initially, I just set the new `board.state` directly from the JSON, but then realised this bypassed the `makeItem()` functionality which was my second line of validation against bad data, so I refactored to loop over lists and tasks to use `addList()` and `addItem()`.


#### 1h - Improve list and task referencing within the API

Now that the API was nearly finished, I had begun to notice that some of the referencing was a little clunky, using `id`s here, references there, etc. I suspected that `getList()` and `getItem()` could be updated to pass any kind of reference (`index`, `id`, `list/item`) and they could. Adding this functionality then only going through `getItem()` cleaned up the store code tremendously.


#### 1h 30m - Added edit list functionality

A little trickier than I first suspected, due to the simple nature of the edit not requiring a modal to edit the list, so requiring different behaviour than the existing edit components.

Initially, I planned to click an edit icon, exactly like the `Card` components, to swap out the list label for an edit field. However, it felt fiddly and weird clicking a tiny icon, so I decided to make the whole label clickable.

After adding the initial code to `create`, `focus`, `enter`, `cancel` and `blur` the new input field, it became obvious that the functionality belonged in some kind of "inline edit" component rather than a custom "header edit" component. As such, a little extra effort was taken [to create this interim component](https://github.com/davestewart/app-diary/commit/52f76cb4a9b650a8f67330464d5e474a8d6cd710), then a bit of fiddling with the existing components to [create a cohesive API](https://github.com/davestewart/app-diary/commit/27b5069d6c598508a383525b1a54b287c80d634d) for all edit-type components with `@submit` and `@cancel` events.

#### 2m - Changing edit item behaviour

With the list titles now being editable on click, it felt weird editing the items using an icon, so I made the items editable by clicking instead of clicking an icon.

#### 5m - Add remove item behaviour

With the lists now editable by clicking, it was next to no effort to change the "edit item" icon to a "remove item" icon, and wire up the store event handlers.

#### 25m - Add remove list behaviour

The [remove list](https://github.com/davestewart/app-diary/commit/2eead960d9f9f0fe9a8c09267747c13deda87f7f#diff-3f22133c492e7ba08efbcededf158e00) functionality took a little more effort, as the additional functionality to show / hide the icon and trigger the behaviour required an interim component to be built. As such, the handlers, styles and markup was moved to a new `ListHeader` component, then events were forwarded to the `Board` component, and a little extra styling added.

There might have been better ways to do this, but at this point, I wanted it finished!


## Conclusion

As usual, the polishing to get an application to 1.0 takes a little while, so not much to report, other than it's now done.
