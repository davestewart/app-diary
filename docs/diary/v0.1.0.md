# Alpha 1

> The initial alpha build; what I thought would be a solid base for future expansion

## TLDR

Setup:

- Don't waste ANY time on scaling, such as:
    - custom build configuration
    - future-proof folder structure
    - routing

Being clever:

- Remember, the aim of the game is to get it working:

    - model your data using the simplest technique
    - don't use Vuex at this stage; you'll waste too much time writing code you won't use

Research:
    
- Look at as many demos as you can, and if one does it better, take inspiration / plagiarise!


## Overview

I planned to build a robust starting setup that would show potential to scale, including:

- logically siloed folders
- Webpack aliases
- routing
- Vuex (state, actions, mutations, etc)
- a normalised data structure

Once in place, I expected it to be reasonably simple to build the actual Trello clone.


## Diary - 1 to 2 hours

#### 30m - Project setup

Installed project using Vue CLI 3.

This was a mistake as I discovered quite quickly that there wasn't a webpack `base.config` I could edit like my other projects (Vue CLI 3 had only just come out). Vue CLI 3 abstracts the config into functions, which I did not have time to learn, which meant it would be time-consuming to add Webpack [folder aliases](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias).

I deleted the project and created a new project using Vue CLI 2.

In the install I added [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). Upon completion I added [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), [VeeValidate](https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate), and [Vue.Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable) via NPM.

Next I updated the linting, enabling `comma-dangle`.

I then refactored the folder structure to something a little more friendly for a robust project setup:

```folders
├─ src
    +- app
    |   +- routes
    |   +- state
    |   +- views
    |   |   +- elements
    |   |   +- ui
    |   +- utils
    +- core
    |   +- components
    |       +- ui
    +- res
        +- styles
```

Then, I set up webpack aliases to the most common folders, so I wouldn't need to type `@src/app/views/elements` etc all the time.

#### 30m - Routing and Vuex

Having moved `home/` and `about/` pages I realised that adding content to them at this early stage was going to be a waste of time, so I removed the routing, Home and About pages, as well as the navigation markup.

I then removed the `<router-view>` an in its place added a new `Board` component, which contained a looped `List` component, which contained a looped `Task` component.

Note that at this stage the data would need to be passed down as props (which turned out to be a mistake!). 

Next, I looked to set up Vuex. 

I set up Vuex with an initial module, with a single state property `lists` and CRUD  mutations for lists and tasks:

```js
const state = {
  lists: [],
  tasks: [],
}

const mutations = {
  addList(state) { ... },
  updateList(state, list) { ... },
  addTask(state, {list, task}) { ... },
  updateTask(state, task) { ... },
  // move list, move task, etc
}
```

Whilst writing the stub Vuex mutations I realised at this point that the normalised lists approach was a bad idea and just too complex for a fast prototype!

I removed the tasks and mocked up some JS for nested lists and items:

```js
const lists = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'List 1',
    items: [
      {
        id: 2,
        title: 'Task 1',
        description: 'This is Task 1',
        date: null
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...  
]
```

#### 30m - Views and components

I began to work on the drag and drop. 

Without any DOM, CSS or events to get me started, it suddenly looked like I had a lot of work to do, and I was approaching 1:30 in to a supposedly 4-hour task – minus an hour for unit tests.

Rather than code everything from scratch, I needed some demo code I could at least copy and paste to get me started; there would be room-enough to "make it mine" once I knew what it was doing.

Looking at the main [multi-list demo](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable/blob/master/examples/Two_Lists.html) on the Vue.Draggable site, it was clear that it wasn't built using SFCs. I quickly grocked the additional code, then looked to see if there was a live demo - there wasn't – I had to clone the repo and run. A few minutes later and with the demos running, it turned out that the nice "list to list" demo previewed on the home page didn't exist in that form in the demos; we got an un-styled green monstrosity instead.

!> Package authors - it pays to supply good looking demos!

At this point, I decided to go back to the [Awesome Vue Drag and Drop](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#drag-and-drop) examples and see if there was a plugin that might just have everything ready to go. As luck would have it, the second to last drag and drop plugin [Vue Smooth Dnd](https://github.com/kutlugsahin/vue-smooth-dnd) didn't just have a [demo link](https://kutlugsahin.github.io/vue-smooth-dnd/) on the readme, but it defaulted to the Cards demo, and was super-smooth!

Decision made.

I cloned the repo and loaded up the Cards demo and it was clear that I had been going about things the wrong way:

- markup was in the single base file, no nesting of components, no need for props
- data was in the base file which made it easy to see what was going on
- the lack of Vuex made it much more obvious how the plugin should interact with the store

I decided at this point that a whole new approach to getting this prototype build was needed! 


## Conclusion

#### Setup

My ideas to build in flexibility from the outset, to over-deliver and wow them with clever touches went out the window when I realised I'd spent 45 minutes installing plugins, rearranging the folders and modifying the webpack config to something that would scale up in some hypothetical future.


#### Architecture

Introducing Vuex at this early stage added too many layers which made it more time consuming to flesh out ideas.

I also over-complicated both components and data.

My plan to normalise the lists and tasks into some kind of backend-friendly data structure looked nuts when faced with such a short timescale. There was no way that the time allowed for the a) coding time to build the extra machinery or b) the thinking time to either research or figure out how to do it.  

My approach of using nested components, whilst fine in itself, looked shaky when comparing it to the demo code. Whereas I would be encapsulating functionality and passing down props, it was far more flexible to manage the markup, data and hierarchy in a single file – something to bear in mind for this kind of hierarchical dataset!

#### Time

When you're working in the coding bubble, time seems to pass more slowly. It's only when you look at just how long things take, that you realise that something you think "takes 5 minutes" is actually 20, 30, 40 minutes.

Accept that you will under-estimate, and counter it by:

- not planning for the future during prototyping
- only setting up or building what is required


#### Overall

I should have kept the whole thing simple from the start, and only added complication when it was needed.

All the ideas for "features" just felt a bit silly; it's good to visualise the end product, but it should not get in the way of prototyping.
