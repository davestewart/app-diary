## Intro

> A senior developer's journey into rapid application prototyping

As an experienced developer of 15+ years, I'm used to building large, complex sites, with scalable architecture, clean code and best practices. Imagine how surprised I was when all this experience fell flat when [tasked](intro/background) with a 4-hour coding challenge to build a basic [Trello](https://trello.com) clone:

It turns out that the architectural skills I've spent years building up simply just got in the way when it came to throwing something together, and I learned the hard way that to complete the challenge I needed to switch my mindset from army commander to street fighter.

In hindsight, the time constraint was ridiculous, but what it took with one hand it gave with the other; ultimately the frugality required to meet the deadline resulted in decisive, unfussy work, and a significant boost in productivity.

Yes, corners had to be cut, and yes, I had to do things I felt uncomfortable with, but I discovered a focused, cyclical way of working, alternating from getting it done and then and *only then* getting it right, which I want to explore further.

For more information on the test see the [background](intro/background.md) page.


## Project

This project aims to document the learning from the initial challenge, then continue the process to build out the finished product, using the same tight deadlines and guerrilla development techniques that got so much achieved the first time.

I'll build new features in short, estimated sprints, and will diarise my thoughts, planning, and crucially *timings* for everything from research to specific programming tasks. When things go wrong, I'll record it, and at the end of the sprint I'll summarise the achievements and insights.

On completing a sprint I'll make sure to refactor if necessary, mitigating technical debt and providing a solid foundation for the next feature.

For more information on questions see the [questions](intro/questions.md) page.

## Goal

The goal of the entire project is to investigate and differentiate the processes that work for scale or for speed, and to develop the wisdom to pick the right one at the right time.

I'm making the project public as I think it's an interesting process, and it's a way for me to give back. Additionally it will be good to [share thoughts](https://github.com/davestewart/app-diary/issues) with developers who have similar experiences, questions or comments.


##Â Updates

If you're interested to get project updates, the best way to would be to [watch](https://github.com/davestewart/web-app-diary/subscription) the repository.

I'll also announce progress on my Twitter feed, which is [@dave_stewart](https://twitter.com/dave_stewart).
